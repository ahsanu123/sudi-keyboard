# üåø _Sudi_ V2

Sudi V2 is custom wireless split keyboard based on NRF52832 Nordic Semiconductor Microcontroller series, each side consist 18 keys 36 in totals, use MCP23017 I2C 
I/O expansion to scan one side of keyboard, and use wire to trasfer data to NRF52. Built in SWD debug port, with Serial Logger based on CH340G. Sudi Have interactive 
RGB LED and OLED 0.91 inch for graphic display. Planned to create 3D print enclosure.


## üíæ hardware 
hardware is designed with Kicad, you can find out hardware design in `pcb-design` folder.

- üî• Learn more about Zephyr
- ~~change JTAG debugger to component with less space and same pinout based on JLink v8 pinout.~~
- üîã ~~battery/and its charger need adjustment, because NRF5232 power supply range is 1.7 V to 3.6 V , and TP4056 will shutdown on 4.2V. if you add AMS1117 3.3v to regulate it, AMS1117 need at least 4.5V to maintain its 3.3V.~~ (NAH, use buck boost instead)

- üé∞ able to run and flash RMK example with jlink and probe-rs ‚è∞ 9 Mei 2025, 20:19
- basic setup on WSL, so able to develop in WSL ‚è∞ 20 Mei 2025, 05:26

  to debugging you need bridge usb device from windows to wsl with `usbipd`

  ```shell
  C:\Windows\System32> usbipd list
  Connected:
  BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE

  C:\Windows\System32> usbipd bind --busid 1-6

  C:\Windows\System32> usbipd attach --wsl --busid 1-6
  usbipd: info: Using WSL distribution 'Arch' to attach; the device will be available in all WSL 2 distributions.
  usbipd: info: Detected networking mode 'nat'.
  usbipd: info: Using IP address 172.27.144.1 to reach the host.

  ```


  then you can access the usb device as in linux

- 24 Mei 2025, trying to run trouble bas example, its give good sign, even 5v sepic is died for now -> https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble/blob/main/examples/apps/src/ble_bas_peripheral.rs ‚è∞ 09:01 

- 25 Mei 2025, able to read uuid for battery level on trouble bas example, also create basic reading uuid with bleak python library, but its really intermitent, bluez is more robust, several note to use and connect bluez with device.

also flashed firmware is from trouble example, current v2 firmware is compiled but not running, ü™û need to investigate it

```shell
$ bluetoothctl
hci0 new_settings: powered bondable ssp br/edr le secure-conn
Agent registered

[bluetoothctl]> connect FF:E4:05:1A:8F:FF
[bluetoothctl]> disconnect FF:E4:05:1A:8F:FF
[bluetoothctl]> menu gatt
[bluetoothctl]> list-attributes
[bluetoothctl]> select-attribute /org/bluez/hci0/dev_FF_E4_05_1A_8F_FF/service0020/char0021
[bluetoothctl]> read
[bluetoothctl]>
```

- 3 Juli 2025, reading more about trouble, here is `trouble-host-macro` documentation located https://docs.rs/trouble-host-macros/latest/trouble_host_macros/ , here are some note
  - Peripherals may use **GATT** (Generic Attribute Profile) to expose **services** and **characteristics**,
  - still many question about why linker cant linking ble exampl (stack is overflow) even though its identical with example
  - this error ` cannot move location counter backwards (from 3ffdeca8 to 3ffdc000` is because `embassy-executor` `task-arena-<size>` i am not sure why and what value its shouuld be. but without defining task arena its compiled but `panic` on runtime.
  - ok, i find out making `embassy-executor` have `embassy-executor = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["task-arena-size-8192"]}` will make it compiled üòô, need to learn what is that.

finally at ‚è∞ 21:46 its compiled and able to run, its discoverable with phone

- 23 Agustus 2025, finally my first SUDI was broke (MCU) and I must finish SUDI v2 for working.
- 24 agustus 2025, basic bas for nrf is compiled and flashed, ‚è∞ 13:25 
  <img width="1284" height="378" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/927c074d-6ae7-46d9-94de-ee9862d3ff24" />

  ‚è∞ 21:29, able to advertise device as bluetooth hid, but still cant establishing connection to keyboard,
  need to understand how HID keyboard is connected in USB and in BLE.

- 11 September 2025, after reading more about BLE spesification, to more understand what each endpoint / characteristic does in BLE HID, you need to:
  * read characteristic code from [bluetooth assigned number](http://bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Files/Specification/HTML/Assigned_Numbers/out/en/Assigned_Numbers.pdf). for example look at `2a4a` from `hid_info` property in this struct (take from RMK github)
    ```rust
    #[gatt_service(uuid = service::HUMAN_INTERFACE_DEVICE)]
    pub(crate) struct HidService {
        #[characteristic(uuid = "2a4a", read, value = [0x01, 0x01, 0x00, 0x03])]
        pub(crate) hid_info: [u8; 4],
        #[characteristic(uuid = "2a4b", read, value = KeyboardReport::desc().try_into().expect("Failed to convert KeyboardReport to [u8; 67]"))]
        pub(crate) report_map: [u8; 67],
        #[characteristic(uuid = "2a4c", write_without_response)]
        pub(crate) hid_control_point: u8,
        #[characteristic(uuid = "2a4e", read, write_without_response, value = 1)]
        pub(crate) protocol_mode: u8,
        #[descriptor(uuid = "2908", read, value = [0u8, 1u8])]
        #[characteristic(uuid = "2a4d", read, notify)]
        pub(crate) input_keyboard: [u8; 8],
        #[descriptor(uuid = "2908", read, value = [0u8, 2u8])]
        #[characteristic(uuid = "2a4d", read, write, write_without_response)]
        pub(crate) output_keyboard: [u8; 1],
    }
    ```
  * search `2a4a` on BLE Assigned number you will find **HID Information**
    <img width="244" height="33" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a436093-56ed-4860-a73a-7f92cf08889c" />
  * from that information (HID Information), look at [HID over gatt profile](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/hid-over-gatt-profile-1-0/)
    <img width="662" height="287" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce5a493c-50f0-479e-b636-b49faca6f79b" />
  * it will give you basic information of what is **HID information** is
  * to understand more about what value should provided by your device, you can continue to [Device Class Definition for HID](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/hid1_11.pdf), and try to search keyword from _HID over gatt profile_ description, for example `bcountryCode`, search on _Device class definition for HID_ then you will find **HID Descriptor**
    <img width="1041" height="709" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ea69aa2-a904-4ca6-8700-0923f856628a" />
  * from that information you can conclude `value = [0x01, 0x01, 0x00, 0x03])]` is HID Descriptor, then
  * `0x01` is _bLength_
  * `0x01` is _bDescriptorType_
  * `0x00` is _bcdHID_
  * `0x03` is _bCountryCode_
